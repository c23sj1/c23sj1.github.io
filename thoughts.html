    <p>My first project was moods. The idea behind this project was that it would cheer people up f they weren't feeling happy. Then it expanded to other emotions.</p>
    <p>Right now I am working on a project where I illustrate two passages from a book about jellyfish called Spineless. The two passages are supposed to contrast the jellyfish boom that happened a while ago with effects of the industrial revolution. I am pretty excited by this project because jellyfish are cool. As of right now, I am working on a background and drawing some jellyfish.</p>
    <p>Now that I have a few drawings of some jellyfish (though they are still a work in progress) I am beginning to plan out the actual aesthetics of the project. I have broken up the first part passage into pieces and they are all on a different slide in Twine. I am planning on now working on the background.</p>

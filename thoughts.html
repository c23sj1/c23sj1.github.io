    <p>My first project was moods. The idea behind this project was that it would cheer people up f they weren't feeling happy. Then it expanded to other emotions.</p>
    <p>Right now I am working on a project where I illustrate two passages from a book about jellyfish called Spineless. The two passages are supposed to contrast the jellyfish boom that happened a while ago with effects of the industrial revolution. I am pretty excited by this project because jellyfish are cool. As of right now, I am working on a background and drawing some jellyfish.</p>

    <p>My first project was moods. The idea behind this project was that it would cheer people up f they weren't feeling happy. Then it expanded to other emotions.</p>
    <p>Right now I am working on a project where I illustrate two passages from a book about jellyfish called Spineless. The two passages are supposed to contrast the jellyfish boom that happened a while ago with effects of the industrial revolution. I am pretty excited by this project because jellyfish are cool. As of right now, I am working on a background and drawing some jellyfish.</p>
    <p>Now that I have a few drawings of some jellyfish (though they are still a work in progress) I am beginning to plan out the actual aesthetics of the project. I have broken up the first part passage into pieces and they are all on a different slide in Twine. I am planning on now working on the background.</p>
    <p>So I have now created a website called lucky ducky which exists because I was worried about a test so I made something that would make me lucky. I like this project because four leaf clovers are cool.</p>
    <p>I made a new project using arrays. This project was originally going to have some of my favorite parts of the universe, but then I decided to instead put drawings of how some parts of the Milky Way were originally depicted. I made this using arrays.</p>
    <p>I have completely redesigned my jellyfish project as well. It now has nothing to do with the book Spineless and is a jellyfish map.</p>
    <p>I have now completed the project FizzBuzz. Essentially, the project is a counter except instead of any mulitple of 3 it says Fizz and the same for 5 and Buzz. For mulitples of 3 and 5 (multiples of 15), it says FizzBuzz. I found this project to be slightly difficult, but really fun to do.</p>
    <p>I have started working on my oceans project again, right now I am focusing on getting the world to spin and to put the circles on the map.</p>
    <p>I am still working on my oceans project. Right now, I am working on getting the images to load on the page.</p>
    <p>I have finished my oceans project and I feel pretty good about it.</p>
    <p>I have started a new project that involves swarming bananas that move randomly around the page. I am pretty excited by it. However, I cannot get the bananas to swarm.</p>
    <p>I decided to change the bananas to robots, but am still having difficulty getting them to swarm.</p>
    <p>I finished the robots project, having gotten them to swarm. I really like the project.</p>
    <p>I was just looking at the Eating Animals project and am going to comment on what I think is going on. First, I think there is an event listener on the food plate. When it is clicked on, there is an array that produces a random image of some meat dish. Then, I think there is an if then statement - if one image shows up on the plate, then a corresponding image appears in the "what I think and what I feel" place of that animal.</p>

    <p>My first project was moods. The idea behind this project was that it would cheer people up f they weren't feeling happy. Then it expanded to other emotions.</p>
    <p>Right now I am working on a project where I illustrate two passages from a book about jellyfish called Spineless. The two passages are supposed to contrast the jellyfish boom that happened a while ago with effects of the industrial revolution. I am pretty excited by this project because jellyfish are cool. As of right now, I am working on a background and drawing some jellyfish.</p>
    <p>Now that I have a few drawings of some jellyfish (though they are still a work in progress) I am beginning to plan out the actual aesthetics of the project. I have broken up the first part passage into pieces and they are all on a different slide in Twine. I am planning on now working on the background.</p>
    <p>So I have now created a website called lucky ducky which exists because I was worried about a test so I made something that would make me lucky. I like this project because four leaf clovers are cool.</p>
    <p>I made a new project using arrays. This project was originally going to have some of my favorite parts of the universe, but then I decided to instead put drawings of how some parts of the Milky Way were originally depicted.</p>
    <p>I have completely redesigned my jellyfish project as well. It now has nothing to do with the book Spineless and is a jellyfish map.</p>
